## Migration Guide (1.x â†’ 2.0)

### For CLI Users

**Old usage:**
```bash
python AudiobookMakerPy.py /path/to/files/
```

**New usage:**
```bash
audiobookmaker /path/to/files/
```

### For Programmatic Users

**Old usage:**
```python
# Import from main script
from AudiobookMakerPy import process_audiobook
```

**New usage:**
```python
# Import from package
from audiobookmaker import AudiobookProcessor

processor = AudiobookProcessor()
result = processor.process_audiobook(["/path/to/files/"])
```

### Installation

**Old installation:**
```bash
# Manual script usage
python AudiobookMakerPy.py
```

**New installation:**
```bash
# Package installation
pip install .

# Development installation
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Upgrade Notes

### Configuration
- Configuration files remain compatible
- Environment variables unchanged
- Log file format unchanged

### Dependencies
- External dependencies (FFmpeg only) unchanged
- Python dependencies now optional (mutagen, pydub)
- Minimum Python version: 3.7

### Breaking Changes
1. **CLI Command**: Use `audiobookmaker` instead of `python AudiobookMakerPy.py`
2. **Import Paths**: All imports now use `audiobookmaker` package
3. **API Changes**: New class-based API for programmatic usage
4. **Package Structure**: Files moved to `src/audiobookmaker/` structure

### Compatibility
