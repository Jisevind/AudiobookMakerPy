## Migration Guide (1.x â†’ 2.0)

### For CLI Users

**Old usage:**
```bash
python AudiobookMakerPy.py /path/to/files/
```

**New usage:**
```bash
# Command line interface
audiobookmaker /path/to/files/

# Graphical interface (v2.1.0+)
python src/audiobookmaker/gui.py
# or use the executable
./dist/AudiobookMaker-GUI
```

### For Programmatic Users

**Old usage:**
```python
# Import from main script
from AudiobookMakerPy import process_audiobook
```

**New usage:**
```python
# Import from package
from audiobookmaker import AudiobookProcessor

processor = AudiobookProcessor()
result = processor.process_audiobook(["/path/to/files/"])
```

### Installation

**Old installation:**
```bash
# Manual script usage
python AudiobookMakerPy.py
```

**New installation:**
```bash
# Package installation
pip install .

# Development installation
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Upgrade Notes
